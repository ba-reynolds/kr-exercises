## K&R Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various exercises from the classic book "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (K&R).

Each file in the `src/` directory corresponds to a specific exercise or problem from the book. The code is provided as-is, mainly for reference and to showcase my progress through the exercises.
